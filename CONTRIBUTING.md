# Contributing

Mutagen Compose welcomes community contributions, especially feedback and
experience reports. See below for more information on the best channels for each
of these.


## Issues

Issues are best submitted via the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen-compose/issues). If you're
reporting a security issue (or even just something that you *think* might be a
security issue), then please follow responsible disclosure practices and submit
the issue report using the instructions found in the
[security documentation](SECURITY.md).


## Experience reports

Experience reports are an essential part of improving Mutagen projects. These
reports might include problems you've had, use cases that aren't covered by
existing features, or even just general thoughts about how to improve Mutagen
Compose. All of this also applies to Mutagen's website, documentation, and
community portals. You can send your feedback via the
[Mutagen Community Slack Workspace](https://mutagen.io/slack), submit it via the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen-compose/issues), or even
just email us at [hello@mutagen.io](mailto:hello@mutagen.io).


## Pull requests

---

**Please note:** I'm still working on formulating Mutagen's pull request policy.
I'm trying to make it as simple as possible while ensuring code quality and
project longevity. I very much want community contributions, but I haven't had
an extensive amount of time to review pull requests or formulate a review
process. I'm working on changing this, so I ask you to bear with me for just a
little longer. Thank you!

Before taking the time to implement a change or feature, please discuss the
proposed change on the
[Mutagen Community Slack Workspace](https://mutagen.io/slack).

If it *does* make sense to open a pull request, please adhere to the following
guidelines. Pull requests that don't follow these guidelines will simply be
closed.


### Contributor License Agreement

Mutagen Compose pull requests will require a Contributor License Agreement,
though the exact form of this agreement is still being decided.


### Code guidelines

In order to ensure that Mutagen Compose's codebase remains clean and
understandable to all developers, we kindly request that:

- Code adheres to Go style guidelines, including those in
  [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and the
  [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- All code be `go fmt`'d
- Comments be wrapped at 80 columns (with exceptions for long strings like URLs)
- Comments be used to break up code (see existing code for examples) and be
  composed of full and complete sentences
- New code include full test coverage

Basically, when in doubt, new code should share the same style as the
surrounding code.


### Commit guidelines

To help keep source control logs readable and useful, we also ask that all
commits have well-formatted commit messages composed of a single subject line of
50-70 characters, followed by a blank line, and finally the full, correctly
punctuated commit message (also wrapped to 80 lines). We ask the same for the
pull request message itself.

Here's an example of a good message:

    Modified synchronization controller state locking

    This commit modifies the synchronization controller's state locking to take
    into account changes that can occur during shutdown. It requires that the
    synchronization Goroutine hold the state lock until fully terminated.

    Fixes #00000

Here's an example of a not-so-good message:

    fixes sync
